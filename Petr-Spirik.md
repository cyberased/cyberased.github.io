I am a cyber, security and privacy enthusiast with passion for cross-disciplinary implications of technology development to all of us. Cyberpunk, horror & dystopia are my favourite genres, yet I prefer them to stay in the fiction department of my library. I read, think & form opinions a lot. 

This is a personal space to capture my thoughts & ideas, as well as to store bits & pieces of information I find interesting.
